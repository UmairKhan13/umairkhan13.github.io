# Muhammad Umair Khan Personal website

This is my personal website built using ReactJS and Bulma as the CSS framework. [Live here](https://www.muhammadumairkhan.com)

The personal information on the website is populated from a json file that follows the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) open source standard.

Use Node v16.15.1

## Customizing it

Feel free to fork this project and update it with your own information and style. Just update the ´src/resume.json´ with your personal information.

If you improve the app in any way a PR would be very apreciated ;)
